# SteamRelocator

[In Progress]

A mass steam game mover, allowing for disk library creation and deletion. Steam currently only lets you move 1 game at a time, and boy is that a pain.


This program actually moves the files vs similar programs that only create NTFS junctions.


Currently Windows only.
